***** HACK INFORMATION ******

-- NAV.asp --
1. Loads In *ALL* Categories from Current Entry 
2. Splits categories based on the ", " expression to a Temp Array
3. Merges categories Into Main Array
4. Sorts Array alphabetically (To remove duplication)

-- ViewCat.asp --
1. Executes an ADODB statement with the "LIKE" query in it, so it can pick up an extract from the categories


*****************************
Limitations - Categories are forced to "Title Case" as, Sorting Sub is CaSe SeNsItIvE
	    - BubbleSort can be slow for a large amount of data
*****************************
Other Information
	    - Categories are not invidividually linked on entries, 
              either remove the hyperlink to the ViewCat.asp page
              or use my split array to separate them (Down to personal choice)
