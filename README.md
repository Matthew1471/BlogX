# BlogX
The award winning open source Classic ASP blogging engine.

----

BlogX was my creation from 21st January 2004 (when I would have been 16 years old) until 2012.
At the time I wrote BlogX, the ASP.NET environment was in its infancy and was horrendously slow and unreliable.

Based on Chris Anderson's BlogX for ASP.NET (~~[simplegeek.com](http://www.simplegeek.com/)~~) I set about creating not only a rewrite of the WebBlogX platform for Classic ASP but one that I think eventually vastly superseded the functionality of most blogging platforms at the time.

Even today some of the algorithms (complete HTTP proxy/cache friendliness, unobtrusive spam protection and bruteforce protection) and features (which would be boring to even list) are not in most products I have seen online.

So, why kill it?
----

Simple, Classic ASP is a dead language, and while probably a contentious opinion that I hold, with more recent versions of IIS it has become clear (to me anyway) that IIS is meant to host Intranet sites now and not run the web.

The way we access the Internet has changed, gone are the big screens and minimalism (with the right mix of security) is now in.

So, why upload the code?
---
I hope this code is useful, either for pure nostalgia/reference or to help support your legacy installation. If you want to carry on contributing feel free but I will no longer be running a production version of BlogX.

What's the future?
----
Certainly not WordPress. I have looked around at PHP blogging code and I think with the right features, [AnchorCMS](https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms) will carry on where I left off.

It'll take a while to add back in the clever algorithms I originally wrote and I want to review the AnchorCMS code to check its security matches what we expect with the new wave of online threats.. but it's my belief that with the right mix of simplicity and microblogging products such as AnchorCMS is where the future lies.

Maybe I'm wrong.. but we will soon know.

Thank you for your support in my programming over the past decade.
