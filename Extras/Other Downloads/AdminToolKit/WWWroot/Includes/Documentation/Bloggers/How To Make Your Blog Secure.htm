<h3>Matthew1471 Security Readme</h3>

<p><u><b>Security Information:</b></u><br>
When the AdminToolkit first creates an account, it retrieves a database from a temporary pool of files, normally this shouldn't matter, but as your blog is being hosted on the same server as other Blogs, this is a huge security risk.<br><br>

1. When a Blog is created the default password is "admin" and "letmein", you are <b>strongly</b> advised to change this straight away.<br><br>

2. When a Blog is created, the "CookieName" sent to the site is always the same, it is <b>strongly</b> advised for you to change the cookie name in the config to a random string of numbers and digits. Otherwise when a fellow Blogger logs in to his/her Blog, he or she may find they also have control over your Blog because the credentials information matches.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Additional Information:<br>
</u></b>You can change the cookie name and password configuration at any time by clicking
&quot;Config&quot; & &quot;Change Password&quot; in the &quot;Admin&quot; panel<br>
<br>
<u><b>New Version Information:</b></u><br>
If security has been improved in the latest BlogX version, you might want to contact the site's administrator and ask if they could please update your blog to the latest version.<br>
