<h3>Matthew1471's Guide To Legal Issues</h3>

<p><u><b>Introduction:</b></u><br>
Blogs allow people to express their feelings about people and things, but what happens when things go wrong?<br>
<br>

<b><u>Basic Instructions:</u></b><br>
I appreciate there are always two different kinds of people protesting abuse, those who have had the odd comment made against them and
wine incessantly and those who have had really awful derogatory inappropriate and
completely unwarranted pictures or other offensive material posted about them.<br><br>

Here are the available options :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Appreciate that Blogs are a snapshot of the mind at a specific time, views can and will change, The blogger may even write a retraction.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Don't take action to it, Offensive Bloggers are just looking for a reaction to Blog further about.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Due to BlogX's &quot;No Going Back On What Was Said&quot; design, it is
    impossible to delete previous entries over the web, Only a site
    administrator would have the ability to do such a thing (and even then
    they'd have to understand about Access tables and record ID's). The best
    thing to hope on the odd comment is that they write a retraction.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Try and contact the Webmaster of the Blog server, see whether they feel the incident is extreme enough to warrant disabling the Blog.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If the content, for example, is pornographic pictures or something of the like, try to bring in other laws which the domain is in breach of (in our example, showing pornographic material without warning has its legal
    ramifications in the UK.)<br>

  </li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Can You Help? :</u></b><br>
Unfortunately, this application is distributed around the internet. I do not have contact with, know of or have seen the majority of Bloggers or Administrators running the BlogX
code (In some cases I don't even know such a domain is using my code).<br><br>

It is therefore needless to say that I cannot really address any issues which are out of my control, no matter how much I sympathize with you.

<br><br>You are welcome to <a href="http://matthew1471.co.uk/Contact.asp">contact me</a> and I will however try my hardest to help provide more
advice or possibly embarrass the blogger into submission or black list the domain from
receiving copies of BlogX in future.<br>
<br>
Please however do not anger me by e-mailing &quot;It's your code, It's your
responsibility to stop it, why don't you do something&quot;, as stated earlier,
it is really out of my control</p>
